This directory containts the final project for an exam  called "Data-Driven Modeling of Complex Systems" held by professor Walter Quattrociocchi in the Data Science master degree.
The project aims to describe the instagram network and its characteristics, from the most common average degree to the average path length.
The analysis is very simple, but it shows the strengh of the graph theory combined to the web scraping.
Some web scraping techniques have been used to extract information from Instagram, then after an initial preprocessing the data have been analyzed through graph theory.
Of course the analysis is incomplete given that taking informations over the entire Instagram network was to complex given the  time and the resources available.
